		In the collective mind, that human consciousness which spreads across all of humanity, ideas exist. Thoughts exist. Bright souls bob, floating in the endless wastes. But most importantly, dreams exist. Dreams are the fish in the sea of our subconscious, the shimmering essence from which all mankind derives motivation, and the spontaneous creation of the motes of consciousness drifting underneath our own, like a river beneath the ice.

	<p class="p" id="p2">
		There are those who step beyond the border. Those who walk behind the curtain. Those who decide to go to sleep, forever or until death, to learn the ways of the sea. They take many different forms, as pirates, as fishers, as sailors…Always human, a few individuals live in the collective mind, working to find what they can find.
	</p>
	<p class="p" id="p3">
		When someone does live in the beyond, as long as their bodies are cared for in reality, their minds are free to stay. They live on the concepts of things, rather than the things themselves.
	</p>
	<p class="p" id="p4">	
		Io exists on the border of the sea. To stay from stepping back through, his conceptual house and new pier extend out into the sea, like a boat-house on the shore. Io’s house has solidified and been understood as the concept of a house, but his pier is still adapting to its new form. It is not ready to be used yet. 
	</p>
	<p class="p" id="p5">
		He was not always this way. Io remembers. In the before, he had friends. A real house. A mother. But these things were thrown away when he discovered that he could go through the veil, and enjoy the delight of the mind forever. How long has he been here? Time is a concept only on the Sea, and thus he could have been there for microseconds or for eons. It did not matter.
	</p>
	<p class="p" id="p6">		
		His preferred occupation was fisherman. Not wanting to stray from the edge of reality, too scared to leave altogether but too happy to go back to a life of suffering, Io fished. His fishing-rod was just that: a fishing rod, or its concept. Io fished for dreams; he loved to watch the souls overhead and the dreams beneath the surface. Few nightmares or powerful dreams came here. It was peaceful.
	</p>
	<p class="p" id="p7">	
		Once, then or yet to be, Io catches or has caught a soul. He forged it into his fish-hook. He does not know whose soul it was, does not care. They were or would have been sinking lower anyway, soon to fall to the seabed. When is irrelevant; whether he caught the soul in the future or past, it was there now, as his fish-hook.
	</p>
	<p class="p" id="p8">
		The dreams Io caught and would catch were varied. Never especially powerful nor atypically weak, they lent him sustenance, created a means for his mind to remain intact. He never touched the ocean, himself. Once, he had even caught a dream of a woman. He decided not to consume her, and threw her back into the sea.	
	</p>
	<p class="p" id="p9">
		There was some reason…Io tried to remember. There was some reason that he could fish. He’d met a fellow traveler, and they had asked why he could fish. He knew the reason, had known, will know, does know, but cannot say. Cannot think about it too hard. It had naught to do with him; if he could fish, and stay intact, he would fish, and enjoy the endless, pink skies full of souls. The human he’d met could have no longer been called human, tatters in their grinning face - faces? There was no danger to him. He would not go far from his house.
	</p>
	<p class="p" id="p10">	
		His pier was finished. Sometime. It was finished. He sat on the end of it, and thought and thought, and reconceptualized time for a moment. He did remember, now; the reason he could fish was in the past, in his past…It had to do with his fishing line. A fishing rod, nothing more, a soul to attract and catch dreams, but the line… Something had to be long, unbreakable, and incorruptible to survive the chaos indefinite contained within the sea of subconscious. Something pure, something that could work over any distance, something unconditional, something not flighty like dreams. Something more flexible than a soul, more powerful than a mere concept…

		The buzzing of the hospital lights and the whirring of the machines sounded like flies in Alex’s ears. She had sat up all night with her son; after the car crash, she had decided she would stay with him. No one was budging her from this spot. The coma he was in had to end. It would end! The doctors didn’t know when, but Alex loved her son too much. She couldn’t abandon him to this wretched fate.
